          <p>
            While behavior learning has made impressive progress in recent times, it lags behind computer vision and
            natural
            language processing due to its inability to lever- age large, human generated datasets. Human behavior has a
            wide
            variance, multiple modes, and human demonstrations naturally donâ€™t come with reward labels. These properties
            limit the
            applicability of current methods in Offline RL and Behavioral Cloning to learn from large, pre-collected
            datasets. In
            this work, we present Behavior Transformer (BeT), a new technique to model unlabeled demonstration data with
            multiple
            modes. BeT retrofits standard transformer architectures with action discretization coupled with a multi-task
            action
            correction inspired by offset prediction in object detection. This allows us to leverage the multi-modal
            modeling
            ability of modern transformers to predict multi-modal continuous actions. We experimentally evaluate BeT on
            a variety of
            robotic manipulation and self-driving behavior datasets. We show that BeT significantly improves over prior
            state-of-the-art work on solving demonstrated tasks while capturing the major modes present in the
            pre-collected
            datasets. Finally, through an extensive ablation study we further analyze the importance of every crucial
            component in
            BeT.

            and

            behaviors from rich, distributionally multi-modal data.</h4>
          <p>Architecture of Behavior Transformer is shown below. (A) The continuous action binning using k-means
            algorithm that lets BeT split
            every action into a discrete bin and a continuous offset, and later combine them into one full action. (B)
            Training BeT
            using demonstrations offline; each ground truth action provides a ground truth bin and residual action,
            which is used to
            train the minGPT trunk with its binning and action offset heads. (C) Rollouts from BeT in test time, where
            it first
            chooses a bin and then picks the corresponding offset to reconstruct a continuous action.</p>

          <p>BeT is based of three key insights.
          <ul style="font-size: 1.125rem;font-weight: 200;line-height: 1.8">
            <li>First, we leverage the context
              based multi-token prediction ability of transformer-based sequence models to predict multi-
              modal actions.</li>
            <li>Second, since transformer-based sequence models are naturally suited to predicting
              discrete classes, we cluster continuous actions into discrete bins using k-means. This allows us
              to model high-dimensional, continuous multi-modal action distributions as categorical distributions
              without learning complicated generative models.</li>
            <li>Third, to ensure that the actions sampled
              from BeT are useful for online rollouts, we concurrently learn a residual action corrector to produce
              continuous actions for a specific sampled action bin.</li>

            two blocks, and the probabilities of pushing one and two blocks to respective squares. For Kitchen, we

          <h2 class="center m-bottom">Future Work</h2>
          <p>In this work, we introduce Behavior Transformers (BeT), which uses a transformer-decoder based
            backbone with a discrete action mode predictor coupled with a continuous action offset corrector
            to model continuous actions sequences from open-ended, multi-modal demonstrations. While
            BeT shows promise, the truly exciting use of it would be to learn diverse behavior from human
            demonstrations or interactions in the real world. In parallel, extracting a particular, unimodal behavior
            policy from BeT during online interactions, either by distilling the model or by generating the right
            â€˜promptsâ€™, would make BeT tremendously useful as a prior for online Reinforcement Learning.
